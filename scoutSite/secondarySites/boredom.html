      <p id="fontsmall">So you've grown bored of staying home for weeks on end, and have turned to complaining on social media about how you're losing your mind and developing a case of dissassociative identity disorder. (I'm not kidding. People in my school are doing this.)</p>
      <br>
      <p id="fontsmall">The key to not "losing your sanity" or developing a self-diagnosed mental illness for internet pity points is to keep yourself busy.</p>
      <p id="fontsmall">Simply, just finding things to do around the house will alleviate the boredom. Cleaning will keep you occupied for hours on end, and the end result is a more open area for you to spend your months-long quarantine in.<img src="deskPic.jpg" id="imageformat">
    </p>
    <p id="fontsmall">Moreso, you're living in a time where technology and electronic communication is taking tremendous strides, and you're telling me that you're BORED? You literally have thousands of Triple A titles to choose from! You don't even have to leave your house to get them! Just download digitally on Steam, Playstation or what ever you use!
    </p>
    <p id="fontsmall">Oh, you want to talk to people? Hmmm. If only services like 
    </p><a href="https://discord.gg">Discord,</a><a href="https://skype.com"> Skype,</a><a href="https://zoom.com"> Zoom,</a><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facetime/id1110145091"> and Facetime</a><p id="fontsmall"> existed. Wouldn't that be FANTASTIC?
        But nah, I guess playing the victim card on social media has it's advantages. All it takes is abandoning your dignity and lowering your classmates view on you. Then again, here I am, sitting in a chair, writing code that functions about as gracefully as a drunken elephant.
